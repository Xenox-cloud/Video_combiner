# This program combines all the mp4 files in the directory
Required packages to install :
* shutil
* moviepy

## Use recursive-combining.py to initiate combining

### Note: If you face any issue regarding "file does not exist"
- its most likely due to filename error due to spaces or "[ ]"
- Remove "[ ]" and use "rename files.py" to replace all spaces into "-"
- then continue.
